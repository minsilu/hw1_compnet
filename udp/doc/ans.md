To create a chat program where two clients can communicate with each other using UDP, the key idea is that each client acts as both a sender and a receiver. UDP is connectionless, so you won’t have a dedicated connection between the two clients as you would with TCP; instead, each client sends messages directly to the other client’s IP address and port.

Two Clients:
Each client sends messages to the other client's IP address and port.
Each client also listens on its own IP address and port for incoming messages.

For example, 
- Client 1
```
bind(port1)
while True:
    send(Message, port2)
    Reply = receive()
    print(Reply)

```
- Client 2
```
bind(port2)
while True:
    Reply = receive()
    print(Reply)
    send(Message, port1)
```
